J3RN's Rubik's Cube Solvers
===========================

Right now there's only a 2x2 solver, and it finds solutions in ~45s on my machine with SWI-Prolog.  I intend to add a 3x3 solver eventually, but feel that I should probably find a way to optimize my general algorithm such that it will finish before the heat death of the universe.
